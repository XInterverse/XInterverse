# Itexel
Itexel is a small company at the moment, we're develping services and applications for people to use. We have seperate teams for our seperate projects. Our most active project right now is the login system. We're hoping to create an OAuth2 Login System by the end of the year. From then on, it will be easier for us to create multiple services all under one login!

# DigitalZero
[DigitalZero](https://digitalzero.tech) is a tech-based group , child company of Itexel, running a website that gives tech guides along with reviews etc. It also has a very active Discord community which you can join [here](https://discord.gg/5ngACFfhkG). A very friendly and active community!
